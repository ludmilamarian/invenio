You may want to change the config file in image_similarity module:
- add some more features to similarity features list (COMBINE, STANDARD, and CLUE), check results by feature for which to take.
- change index batch size (number of images sent to LIRE at a time)
- all the paths, ex: path to indexes folder

You may also want to start the java virtual machine with some parameters to increase, for example, its memory.

The virtual machine (the code is in engine, pylire.initVM() ) , should be started once, and be always running in the background.
