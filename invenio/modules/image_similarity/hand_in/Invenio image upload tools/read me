If you have a folder with some images to add to your invenio instance, run icon creator on the folder then run insertfilesfromfolder on folder and specify an output file for the xml. Also, specify to which collection the images should be added (in insertfilesfromfolder).

then run bibupload on resulting xml file, bibindex, webcoll, etc
